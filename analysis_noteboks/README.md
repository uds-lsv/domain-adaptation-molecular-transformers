# Analysis Folder

This folder contains the results from our different experiments in the 
[results_with_clustered_pretraining_cleaned_adme_microsom](results_with_clustered_pretraining_cleaned_adme_microsom) 
 folder and comparison results to literature in the
[comparison_with_clustered_pretraining_cleaned_adme_microsom](comparison_with_clustered_pretraining_cleaned_adme_microsom)
folder. 

The datasets for pre-training (i.e., GucaMol training set) and downstream (i.e., the ADME benchmark by Fang et. al.,) 
can be found in [pretrain_and_downstream_datasets](pretrain_and_downstream_datasets)

The notebook [performance_analysis.ipynb](performance_analysis.ipynb) provides a walkthrough our analysis methods and figures while 
the notebook [data_analysis.ipynb](data_analysis.ipynb) provides a walkthrough our characterization of the pre-training 
and downstream datasets.
